### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I am a ### Web Developer based in India and currently in the final year of B.Tech in Information Technology. Technology has always interested me and I enjoy nothing more than learning the trends that technology is taking in order to work more efficiently and see progress and success. When I am not glued to my computer screen I play football, cricket and guitar, not very good at it though.
